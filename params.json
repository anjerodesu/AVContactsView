Copy all of the classes and images to your project (except the contents of the *Demo* folder of course)\r\n2. Add `AddressBook.framework` and `AddressBookUI.framework` to your target\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSimply initialize the view controller with the person and address book.\r\n\r\n    SSPersonViewController *personViewController = [[SSPersonViewController alloc] initWithPerson:person addressBook:addressBook];\r\n    [self.navigationController pushViewController:personViewController animated:YES];\r\n    [personViewController release];\r\n\r\nSee the demo project for further examples.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nI originally wrote this for a client. They said it would be fine if I open sourced it and put it in [SSToolkit](http://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit). I had it in a [topic branch](https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit/tree/person) for awhile, but decided to move it to it's own repository instead of adding it to SSToolkit. I figured that most people probably won't use this, but they would have to add `AddressBook.framework` and `AddressBookUI.framework` to their project just to use SSToolkit. I also don't plan on working on this any time soon.\r\n\r\nI did the same thing for [SSMessagesViewController](https://github.com/samsoffes/ssmessagesviewcontroller).\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nThere is [one known bug](https://github.com/samsoffes/sspersonviewcontroller/issues#issue/1). The view will not refresh its data when the address book changes. Feel free to fork and improve!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
